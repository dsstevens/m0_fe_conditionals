# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?  

I feel that I have a great grasp of what comparison operators do and how to use them. It feels like writing analogies.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?  

Again, I feel really good in my understanding of the logical operators and how to use them. It feels like writing logic statements.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?  

I feel great about the if statements as they set up how to phrase the code in the most straightforward way.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?  

I spent the most time reading and studying the lessons on the mod 0 resource page and probably 2 hours just working on this assignment. 
So, way over budget with my calendar and I'm really trying to practice being mindful of when and how to to take a break. 
I budgeted 2 hours per lesson which would include the related assignment but it's more like 4 hours for me. I hit a major wall with energy
yesterday and had to take a break until today to revisit and then knocked it all out.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?  

I'm practicing time management as we speak with a pomodoro timer and that is really helpful for my time awareness. My calendar is very much a living document right now juggling physical therapy and packing to move so I'm giving myselg a lot of grace to just complete everything as I need and revisit my schedule structure after we move and are in mod 1. I want to practice typing the syntax more because right now it makes sense but I still can't remember if I need a space before a parentheses etc.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?  

I skipped over the mild challenge after not getting the answers I needed from specific googling for the operator method necessary to parse out even or odd numbers and spent way too much time trying to figure that out so I will be looking at my group's looms to see how they got there. Also making a lot of bookmarks to my turing folder from the mozilla website with all the info I seemingly could ever need.
